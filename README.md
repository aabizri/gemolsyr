# gemolsyr (ARCHIVED)

Gemolsyr was a modular [L-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system) runner written in Go.

However, it was extremely slow due to issues with the Go garbage collector.
After some time spent trying to optimize it, I decided to forego this approach, and work on a bigger toolkit written in a language with manual memory management, including GPU acceleration.
This other project is W.I.P, but if it goes live at some point, then it will be found on aabizri/vif.
